# Recycling Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based system designed to classify recyclable materials in a video stream. It utilizes YOLO for object detection and a custom-trained CNN model to classify detected objects.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLO to detect objects in the uploaded video.
- **Classification**: Classifies detected objects using a TensorFlow-trained CNN model.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides visual feedback by labeling detected and classified objects on the video.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for video upload and result visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Flask
- YOLO (pretrained weights required)

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with more training data.
- Optimize real-time processing performance.
- Extend support for different types of recyclable materials.
